## DisenKGE-DDI: A Knowledge Graph Embedding Framework Based on Disentangled Graph Attention Networks for Drug-Drug Interaction Prediction

DisenKGE-DDI is a novel model designed for drug-drug interaction (DDI) prediction, leveraging a disentangled graph attention mechanism. By integrating both micro-disentanglement and macro-disentanglement mechanisms, the model effectively captures intricate interaction patterns within multi-relational knowledge graphs.

###  Source codes:

+ data_loader.py: Loads and preprocesses datasets, prepares training and evaluation samples.
+ DisenLayer.py: Implements the disentangled graph layer, projecting node features into multiple latent semantic spaces.
+ helper.py: Contains utility functions for logging, evaluation metrics, random seed control, etc.
+ model.py: Defines the complete model architecture including encoders, attention layers, and disentanglement modules.
+ run.py: The main entry point script for training, validation, and testing.
